    ""Leaders and individuals alike should focus on equality, fairness, and helping others to create a better world","I've had the pleasure of working with some incredibly talented.So generally it is the responsibilty of each and everyone to reflect back to their own lives.Once each individual evaluates and analyzes his or her actions it will then be easier for them to stop judging others and having checked their lives and realise that on this world we all have flaws.Most humans tell themselves that they are good enough or think they are better than others because of the benefits they have at the moment.For example some people are born in rich families and others are born in poor families,the person born on rich family might think they are better and more hard working than those born in poor families,failing to realise no one chooses where to be born or choosing to be poor.Therefore I think the main concern for majority or simply the whole world should be making the world a better place and not a place for competing and humilating others.This also should get to our leaders and they should enhance equality and fairness for its citizens.Leaders should not embezzle public funds for personal selfish gains,but should appropriately use funds to provide social life of citizens so as to reduce the burden of the tax payers.This goes on to a personal level where everyone should take it as his or her responsibility regardless of the position in the society to make sure helping the needy neighbour as long as one has the resources or enough to share.Finally the world should be a better place this can be achieved by minimize judging and more helping.",0.635,USER_AND_API,6,728be0e074184b268c1a44a00ead8e4a.csv,sentence-bert
